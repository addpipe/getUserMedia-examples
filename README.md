# A series of getUserMedia examples that we found useful

The code in this repo, [available here as a live page](https://addpipe.com/getusermedia-examples/), demonstrates the functionality of `getUserMedia()` for everyday media-related tasks, including:
- Video recording
- Audio recording
- Taking pictures
- Listing available media devices

These examples highlight how getUserMedia() powers essential features in modern web applications, making it a vital tool for working with real-time audio and video in the browser.

## Requirements
- The web page needs to be in a [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts);
- The page must not be under a [Permissions Policy](https://blog.addpipe.com/camera-and-microphone-access-in-cross-oirigin-iframes-with-feature-policy/) that's limiting device access;
- You need to have user permission at the browser level and, in some cases, at the operating system level.
